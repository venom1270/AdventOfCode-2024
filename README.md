# AdventOfCode-2024

## In short...

This year it's GO time 😎 ...

... and VIM time 😎 ...

... and stream time 😎 (although we will see how that goes)!


That's about it. Simple, right?

*Also a side note: this chapter was written in VIM!*

Oh, yeah, trying to use a split keyboard (Sofle) with EN key layout! 😎

Phew, now that really is everything! 😅

## Day 1
