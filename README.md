# AdventOfCode-2024

## In short...

This year it's GO time ðŸ˜Ž ...

... ~~and VIM time~~ for the VIM ðŸ˜Ž ... *courtesy of @nsk4*

... and stream time ðŸ˜Ž (although we will see how that goes)!


That's about it. Simple, right?

*Also a side note: this chapter was written in VIM!*

Oh, yeah, trying to use a split keyboard (Sofle) with EN key layout! ðŸ˜Ž

Phew, now that really is everything! ðŸ˜…

## Day 1

It was actually really easy, but had some problems with keyboard (physical and EN layout). Otherwise fine, but streaming this is a bit of a challenge.

## Day 2

That was a rollercoaster. Part 1 was easy as hell, but I wanted to do a fancy solution for part 2... didn't work out ðŸ˜…. Spent *wayyyy* to much time here and in the end opted for the straightforward "bruteforce" solution. Not my best day.

## Day 3

THis day was straightforward and easy. I was a bit scared part 2 was gonna be more complex (nesting) and that I would have to rewrite my loop in recursion form, but that was not neccessary thankfully! ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 4

Pretty easy, got it (almost) first try (stupid GO slices!!). Part 2 easier than part 1, or at least less verbose ðŸ˜„. Onwards!!! ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 5

Parsing was a bit more involved (nothing like last year though, thankfully). Part 1 was easy, part 2 aswell after some thought. This year is going pretty well so far! ðŸ˜Ž *Famous last words...* ðŸ˜…

## Day 6

Pretty easy overall. I liked it a lot. Took a bit more time than previous days. Part 2 took a while to compute (5+ seconds), but the answer was correct. Both part 1 and part 2 worked first try (not counting syntax error and typos). Maybe I could optimeze part 2 a bit by starting the test just 1 move before encountering the new (placed) obstacle, but I would need to save the Position struct when doing Part 1.

## Day 7

That was easier than expected! Dusting off recursion after a while, feels good! An additional challenge for me was talking (IRL, not on stream) while doing this day. But I managed to complete it in ~30min. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¥³

## Day 8

Ramping up... this took almost an hour (actually more if we count input parsing). Had some trouble with GOs references (some array elements were changed because some reference pointed to them), but otherwise the solution was relatively straightforward. Used a map to gather all connected antennas, and then just calulated the distance and extrapoled until valid for part 2. Yeah, we are slowly ramping up, exited for the next days... ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 9

Disk fragmentation-like task. Pretty nice, enjoyed it. Had some bugs which took me some time to solve (especiall part 2), but otherwise not that difficult algorithm-wise. Still going strong!! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

## Day 10

Finally some recursion!! That was quite easy I think I set a personal record ðŸ˜„. I completed both parts even faster than Day 1 ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. Accidentaly did part 2 first and then was bamboozled why part 1 didn't work - note to myself: LEARN TO READ!! ðŸš¨ðŸ˜…ðŸš¨

## Day 11

First hard one - managed to do only day 11. Different methods for day 2 that I tried are too slow ðŸ¤”. I think my method of DFS and memoization should work but I'm clearly missing something. A mystery for another day! ðŸ˜„
