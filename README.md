# AdventOfCode-2024

## In short...

This year it's GO time ðŸ˜Ž ...

... ~~and VIM time~~ for the VIM ðŸ˜Ž ... *courtesy of @nsk4*

... and stream time ðŸ˜Ž (although we will see how that goes)!


That's about it. Simple, right?

*Also a side note: this chapter was written in VIM!*

Oh, yeah, trying to use a split keyboard (Sofle) with EN key layout! ðŸ˜Ž

Phew, now that really is everything! ðŸ˜…

## Day 1

It was actually really easy, but had some problems with keyboard (physical and EN layout). Otherwise fine, but streaming this is a bit of a challenge.

## Day 2

That was a rollercoaster. Part 1 was easy as hell, but I wanted to do a fancy solution for part 2... didn't work out ðŸ˜…. Spent *wayyyy* to much time here and in the end opted for the straightforward "bruteforce" solution. Not my best day.

## Day 3

THis day was straightforward and easy. I was a bit scared part 2 was gonna be more complex (nesting) and that I would have to rewrite my loop in recursion form, but that was not neccessary thankfully! ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 4

Pretty easy, got it (almost) first try (stupid GO slices!!). Part 2 easier than part 1, or at least less verbose ðŸ˜„. Onwards!!! ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 5

Parsing was a bit more involved (nothing like last year though, thankfully). Part 1 was easy, part 2 aswell after some thought. This year is going pretty well so far! ðŸ˜Ž *Famous last words...* ðŸ˜…
